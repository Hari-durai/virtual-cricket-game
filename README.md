Creating a virtual cricket game using Mediapipe involves utilizing computer vision and gesture recognition to simulate the interactions between a player and the game elements.


# Virtual Cricket Game using Mediapipe

This project demonstrates a virtual cricket game using the Mediapipe library for gesture recognition and computer vision. Players can use their hand gestures to simulate playing cricket.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- Mediapipe (`pip install mediapipe`)

## Setup


1. Install the required packages:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

2. Run the virtual cricket game script:

   ```
   python virtual_cricket_game.py
   ```

3. The game window will open, showing the webcam feed with overlaid body pose tracking.

4. Hold your body in front of the webcam, and the program will detect your hand's position.

5. Perform gestures to control the game:
   - Move your hand left or right to adjust the direction of the shot.
   - Move your hand up or down to control shot power.

6. Enjoy playing the virtual cricket game!

## Controls

- Move hand left/right: Adjust shot direction
- Move hand up/down: Control shot power by s
- Make a specific gesture (e.g., fist) to trigger shot
